			<h3><a href="/thoughts/when-a-hackathon-becomes-cheap-crowdsourced-labor">When A Hackathon Becomes Cheap, Crowdsourced Labor</a></h3>
			<p>About nine months ago, I attended my first hackathon and it was amazing. I met awesome designers and developers, and got to be <a href="http://hacknjill.com/blog/hacksgiving-rules-and-judging-criteria/">part of a little movement to use tech for good</a> in the wake of hurricane Sandy. Sponsor prizes seemed to actually mean something, and it <a href="http://sodevious.me/post/51986098138/hackathons-should-not-be-about-business">wasn’t a competition</a>. I wish that hackathons still had the same kind of spirit.</p>

<p>Today, a friend of mine sent me an email <a href="https://www.elance.com/j/mobile-centric-hackathon/42670434/">about attending an upcoming hackathon</a>. It sounded great until I read this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>brief24 offers a fresh approach to creative problem-solving… five Top 100 Fortune participating companies will submit a brief by noon on June 27, 2013, and 24 hours later they will receive a working prototype</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From those lines on, I continued to read just to laugh and be <em>appalled</em> that someone was calling this a ‘hackathon’. Any self respecting designer or developer should spot this as cheap, crowdsourced spec work. It’s a damn shame that anyone would consider even going to this, yet alone <strong>plan</strong> it.</p>

<p>To dig in the knife a little deeper, the <em>‘job posting’</em> was up on Elance - which I had to make an account just to access.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compensation: </p>

<ul>
<li>Designers will be compensated <strong>up to $800</strong> depending on experience </li>
<li>Developers will be compensated <strong>$1000</strong> depending on experience </li>
<li>Includes all meals (lunch, dinner, snacks, breakfast) during this period </li>
<li>All developers and designers <strong>will need to be qualified</strong> through a short preliminary screening process (details to follow). </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, not only are they compensating designers and developers a ridiculous amount of money that they may or may not earn, they have to be vetted! I think this is a joke, honestly. That equates to <strong>$33/hour for designers</strong> at the most, and <strong>$40/hour for developers</strong> in NYC. These rates are pitifully sad, especially for NYC, where a serious designer or developer should charge you at least double that. Remember, this is top notch work done within a 24 period for <strong>Top 100 Fortune companies</strong> at rates that don’t even compete with industry standard in NYC. </p>

<p>A quick google search <a href="https://grouptalent.com/blog/how-much-developers-make-per-city">suggests that</a> developers on average charge $90/hour in New York. Let’s do the math here…</p>

<ul>
<li>8 Hours in a work day: $720</li>
<li>16 overtime hours at time and a half: $2160</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s <strong>$2880</strong> that these developers should be making on average, whereas they are being offered more than half of that at <strong>$1000</strong> for 24 straight hours worth of work.</p>

<p>This is just what my mother warned me about when I started hacking. It’s so sad that this is true.</p>
