            <p>With tools like <a href="http://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>, and <a href="http://sassmeister.com/">Sassmeister</a> you can have your CSS/Sass side by side with your code. Earlier today, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jessabean/status/389102181225598976">saw a tweet</a> asking for the same thing at <a href="https://twitter.com/SassConf">#sassconf</a>, but with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text</a>. Then I was like, wait that&#39;s how my dev environment works.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/sublimepen.png" alt="Sublime Screenie" title="Sublime Screenie"></p>

<p>See? IT&#39;S AWESOME. I use a Mac app called <a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a> + the Chrome browser extension to compile my Sass and to reload the browser on save. It works wonderfully. I don&#39;t have to leave Sublime if I want to see my changes in the browser. I also sometimes use <a href="http://mizage.com/divvy/">Divvy</a> to tighten up the windows, because 13&quot; is small, and gotta take every inch you can take yo.</p>

            <h3><a href="/thoughts/on-design-and-execution">On Design & Execution</a></h3>
            <p>Recently, I have realized that my responsibilities as a designer are to deliver the best product possible, while making decisions that are driven by data and feedback, rather than opinions. Who are you really if you accept &quot;feedback&quot; as an order? At that point are you still a &quot;designer&quot;?</p>

<p>This realization came about from working in a startup environment (Feb 2013) where my opinions were not valued and I was seen as someone that just turned wireframes into pretty pixels and code. By the end of the contract job, I was incredibly frustrated because I didn&#39;t yet have the vocabulary and know how to get my points across in a way that the non-technical co-founders could understand. They didn&#39;t value UX, or feedback from users. They just wanted me to accept mockups that they created for what they were and execute on them. And being so mad the whole time made me see that&#39;s not the person I want to be. And that it wasn&#39;t the right way to manage designers (on their part).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll gladly sit and work with you to solve a problem through design, but I won&#39;t do whatever you say for the sake of your opinion. The fact that you &quot;hired me&quot; means nothing against my practical experience in doing my job.</p>

<p>If you hire me to do a job, I expect that you&#39;ll trust me to do it the right way. It&#39;s not even a matter of questioning my decision making - it&#39;s more of a &quot;I know better than to let you tell me what to do for the sake of your product&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;You&quot; generally refers to a hiring party and/or one that is not a designer or developer.</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Nicole, but I know what&#39;s best for my business!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m passionate about what I do, and that means that I have the best interest of your product and company in mind. As a part of the company, you are a super-user of the product, whereas your users generally are not. We should be designing for them, not for you.</p>

            <p><a href="http://jalcine.me/">Jacky</a> is a friend of mine, and fellow young person here in NYC. I think we&#39;re similar in a lot of ways, and if you look at our skillset, it seems that one of us picks up exactly where the other left off.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts in response to his recent <a href="http://blog.jalcine.me/2013/07/26/going-above-and-beyond.html">&quot;Going Above and Beyond&quot;</a> post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was turned away because I “overengineered”. I was disheartened not because I was turned away per se, but more for to the reason of the such. I didn’t think that I pushed too hard for the project. It was a simple landing page that collected a few fields from the user. The UX was built from slicing up a PSD but outside of that, it was simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, it is indeed possible to go above and beyond in web development. But, it all comes down to how you look at it. I think that Jacky (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) saw the PSD as an end goal rather than a starting point. I belive that front-end work is an intimate relationship between design and code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The application could have been easily built by hacking up a page using HAML and then writing a quick-n-dirty PHP script to handle the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use your backend skills to enhance what the front-end can do. At the end of the day, a website&#39;s design will end up as HTML and CSS no matter how pre-processed it is. And that&#39;s what we have to remember. Use smaller building blocks to enhance that. Bring OOCSS practices to large scale websites with Sass. Write vanilla JS before brekaing out the jQuery, but when you do make it meaningful by enhancing other parts of the site since you&#39;re already including it.</p>

<p><strong>Protip</strong>: <em>Make sure you&#39;re coming at a problem from the right angle.</em> If you don&#39;t know what that angle is, then you don&#39;t understand the problem deep enough. Actually, as a designer my job is to solve problems. Sometimes, there are problems where I&#39;m scratching my head trying to understand how to fix them. The only way to make something better is to understand how and why it&#39;s bad in the first place. Not sure how this ended up as a UX rant.</p>

            <h3><a href="/thoughts/jekyll-gh-pages">How This Blog Works: Jekyll + GitHub Pages + Custom Domain</a></h3>
            <p>I recently moved from a Tumblr blog + custom domain to using GitHub Pages to host and serve my Jekyll powered blog with a custom domain. It&#39;s pretty cool actually, cause all the code is open source and works great with a regular GitHub workflow. Did I mention it&#39;s free and deserves some nerd cred?</p>

<p>At first, Jekyll seems kind of daunting, but once you start your local server and play with the inner workings, you&#39;ll realize that it&#39;s pretty powerful. All it takes is a little knowledge of ruby views and sass - then you&#39;re good to go! <strong>The <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">documentation</a> is super useful.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>So to handle the 301 redirection, I&#39;m using a plugin called <em><a href="https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator">jekyll<em>alias</em>generator</a></em> to generate local post files where the old url goes. Those files contain 301 redirects for the new slug. It&#39;s worth noting that I had to generate these files locally and then put them in the <em>site</em> folder, because GitHub pages won&#39;t run any Jekyll plugins.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the posts are written in markdown, using yaml frontmatter for metadata. I found <em><a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a></em>, a great free Mac app that helps with formatting markdown.</p></li>
<li><p>To get the custom domains working, you have to point your domain to the GitHub Pages IP, which is all laid out in their wonderful <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">documentation</a>. And then in your repo, create a file called &quot;<em>CNAME</em>&quot; with the url of your domain, no www. Here&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/sodevious/sodevious-blog/blob/master/CNAME">mine</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To get it all going, create a branch called gh-pages and push everything there. It will live at <em>yourusername</em>.github.io/<em>your-repo</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Huzzah! Profit! Prosper! Be Merry!</p>

            <h3><a href="/thoughts/bootstrap-thoughts">Bootstrap: Thoughts, Rants and Defending My Stance</a></h3>
            <p>It started with an innocent tweet.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sodevious">@Sodevious</a> have you used twitter bootstrap? Thoughts?</p>&mdash; Joshua Acosta (@Josh_Acosta) <a href="https://twitter.com/Josh_Acosta/statuses/349310935502032896">June 24, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>And then it grew into something much larger... here are my thoughts on Twitter&#39;s Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used Bootstrap a lot. I get why people like it, but I personally don&#39;t. I don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s a &quot;must use&quot; framework - it has it&#39;s place you just have to decide what that will be.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Divitis - I really don&#39;t need to explain this one.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration can most definitely happen in teams with or without Bootstrap. Not every website on the internet is a result of it. It&#39;s entirely possible to create a great, standards-compliant website in collaboration with others without using Bootstrap. I guess because it&#39;s a widely used framework, it seems like a great choice for collaboration, but truthfully - how much better is it than anything else out there? This is the living, breathing web. As web workers, we are the ones that decide what best practices and standards are.</p></li>
<li><p>Bootstrap is not for everyone or for every project; therefore I most definitely can invent a better wheel in some cases on the projects I work on. It&#39;s arrogant to say that it&#39;s a one size fits all, and if I&#39;m not using it then there must be something wrong. Why would I want to? As a front-end developer I give a shit about my work, about how it&#39;s perceived and about how it works within an organization, a team, or just with my own personal projects. Style guides and documentation exist for a reason.</p></li>
<li><p>The existence of better frameworks is entirely true, because the opinion is relative to the user. Obviously time and money come into play, but that doesn&#39;t mean that a bloated framework like Bootstrap is the answer. All of my opinions come from me actually using the framework day in and day out. </p></li>
<li><p>An overused design gives your project and yourself a bad rap. Obviously, yes, the CSS is customizable. However, for quick projects &amp; backend developers, it&#39;s mostly used out-of-the-box. Therefore, its&#39; look is completely overused and as I said before, &#39;hackety&#39;. I&#39;ve done bootstrap theme&#39;ing before; and at the end of the day, I&#39;d rather make dev &amp; design decisions myself, than have to mold myself to fit an <em>okay</em> framework. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bootstrap isn&#39;t for everyone - it has a time and place, and a developer/designer has to make decisions whether to a) use a framework or b) choose to use bootstrap.</p>
